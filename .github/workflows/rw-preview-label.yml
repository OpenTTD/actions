    # When two PRs get the Preview label before they can execute, the first will
    # remove the label from the second, and the second from the first. This would
    # leave no PR with a Preview label. So always make sure that if we finish,
    # our PR has a preview label. As by concurrency one PR always finishes last,
    # the last one is now guaranteed to have a preview label.
